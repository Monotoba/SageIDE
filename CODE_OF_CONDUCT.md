## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of the Sage IDE project, pledge to foster an inclusive and respectful community. We value the diversity of our contributors and strive to create an open and welcoming environment for everyone involved in our project.

## Our Standards

### 1. **Inclusive Environment:**
   We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and identities. Discrimination, harassment, and exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

### 2. **Respectful Communication:**
   Be kind and respectful in all interactions. Disagreements are natural, but respectful discussion and debate are encouraged. Disparaging comments, personal attacks, and trolling will not be tolerated.

### 3. **Safe Discussions:**
   Respect the opinions and ideas of others, especially during discussions related to RFCs (Request for Comments). Constructive criticism is welcome, but remember to be considerate of other contributors' perspectives.

### 4. **Be Collaborative:**
   Collaboration is fundamental to our project's success. Work together, help others, and learn from one another. Support new contributors and provide guidance when needed.

### 5. **Respect Privacy:**
   Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Do not share private or personal information without consent.

### 6. **Reporting Violations:**
   If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it promptly to the project maintainers at [contact@example.com]. All reports will be kept confidential.

## Discussions over RFCs (Request for Comments)

When participating in discussions related to RFCs, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Respectful Feedback:**
   Provide feedback on RFCs in a constructive and respectful manner. Focus on the technical aspects of the proposal and avoid personal attacks.

2. **Open-mindedness:**
   Be open to different viewpoints and be willing to reconsider your opinions based on the merit of the argument. Engage in thoughtful discussion.

3. **Clear Communication:**
   Clearly articulate your ideas and concerns. Use clear and concise language to facilitate effective communication and understanding among contributors.

4. **Consensus Building:**
   Work collaboratively to reach a consensus on RFC proposals. Understand that not all discussions will result in full agreement, but aim for understanding and compromise.

5. **Timely Responses:**
   Respond to RFC discussions in a timely manner, respecting the time and effort of others. If you cannot participate promptly, indicate when you can provide feedback.

By participating in the Sage IDE project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and the guidelines set forth for discussions over RFCs. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in appropriate actions, including but not limited to warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the project community, and reporting to appropriate authorities if applicable.

Thank you for your cooperation in making the Sage IDE project a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone.
