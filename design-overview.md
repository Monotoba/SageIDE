# Sage IDE Project Specification

## Introduction

The Sage IDE redefines the paradigm of software development, seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence to create an unparalleled Integrated Development Environment. Designed for the AI age, Sage IDE merges advanced AI agents - ChatGPT, ChatDev, and Aider AI - with a powerful, modular architecture developed using PyQt6. This document serves as a comprehensive guide, delineating the intricacies of the Sage IDE project, from its core functionalities to its extensible plugin architecture.

## Functional Overview

### Main Workspace

At its core, Sage IDE offers a robust, user-friendly workspace catering to diverse development needs. It boasts a tabbed interface for coding, comprehensive project management tools, and a dynamic "work area" facilitating real-time debugging and output handling. The main window is enriched with intuitive menus, including File (New, Open, Save, Close, Exit), Edit (Cut, Copy, Paste, Find, Replace), View (Project, Terminal, Output, Debugger), and Help (Help, About), ensuring seamless user interactions.

#### Enhanced Features

1. **ToolMenuLeft:** Positioned strategically on the left, this menu houses the "Project View," providing developers with an intuitive way to manage their projects, drawing inspiration from industry-leading IDEs like IntelliJ and VS Code.
   
2. **ToolMenuRight:** Located on the right, it hosts the "Agent" menu, offering a gateway to AI agent windows. From Product Managers to DevOps Engineers, Sage IDE accommodates a diverse array of AI roles, each tailored to specific project domains.

### AI Integration

Sage IDE leverages a trio of core AI agents, each with a distinct role in the development lifecycle:

- **ChatGPT:** This conversational AI aids in ideation, refining project specifications, and offering detailed discussions. Acting as a guiding oracle, ChatGPT ensures developers navigate the intricacies of project design and development with finesse.

- **ChatDev:** With an innate understanding of software development, ChatDev translates project requirements into initial code structures. It interprets concepts, transforming them into executable code, setting the stage for rapid development and agile iterations.

- **Aider AI:** Aider stands as the virtual craftsman, excelling in real-time debugging, code modification, and dynamic enhancements. From altering code to debugging, Aider AI ensures the codebase remains robust and adaptable to evolving project needs.

#### Diverse AI Roles

Beyond the core agents, Sage IDE introduces specialized AI roles catering to specific project domains:

- **Product Manager:** Providing strategic insights, this AI role aligns the project with market demands and user expectations. It serves as the visionary, ensuring project features resonate with market needs and user expectations.

- **Technical Lead | Architect:** As the cornerstone of technical decisions, this AI role architects the software, defining frameworks, technologies, and integrations. It ensures the project's technical robustness and scalability.

- **Development Team:** This multifaceted AI role embodies the collective brilliance of a development team. It fosters collaboration, version control, and agile methodologies, ensuring seamless cooperation among developers.

- **QA Engineer:** Focused on software quality, the QA Engineer AI conducts automated testing, regression testing, and bug identification. It upholds the software's integrity through rigorous testing, guaranteeing a seamless user experience.

- **UX/UI Designer:** Infused with creative genius, the UX/UI Designer AI focuses on wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. It ensures the software is not only functional but also visually appealing, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

- **Database Administrator:** This AI role focuses on data integrity and performance, architecting database schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring seamless data management. It acts as the custodian of the project's data infrastructure.

- **DevOps Engineer:** The DevOps Engineer AI orchestrates continuous integration, deployment, and automation. It ensures the software development lifecycle remains efficient, reliable, and scalable, enhancing project agility.

### Plugin Architecture

#### Structural Flexibility

Sage IDE's plugin architecture stands as a testament to its extensibility, offering developers a canvas for limitless customization:

- **Plugin Storage:** Plugins find their home within the "plugins" sub-folder, each residing in its dedicated directory. This encapsulation ensures modular and scalable functionality.

- **Metadata Precision:** The essence of each plugin is encapsulated in a metadata file, "plugin.dat." This file, rich with essential details like plugin name, version, authorship, and URLs, serves as the compass guiding developers through the plugin landscape.

#### Extending Possibilities

1. **Menu Customization:** Plugins transcend mere additions; they are architects of the user interface. Developers can augment menus in four cardinal directions â€“ Top, Left, Right, Bottom. These meticulously crafted menu items enrich the user experience, ensuring intuitive interactions.

2. **Window Customization:** The window is not static; it is a canvas awaiting the brushstrokes of innovation. Plugins can register methods, adding sub-windows, menus, tabs, and textual content. Each addition enriches Sage IDE, tailoring it to the developer's unique vision, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration.

### Event System

Sage IDE pulsates with an event-driven soul, enabling seamless interactions between developers, the system, its tools, and the content. An exhaustive list of events forms the backbone of Sage IDE, offering a seamless channel for engagement and dynamic responsiveness.

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

In the realm of Sage IDE, code is not just functional; it is a work of art. Adherence to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code ensures not only the elegance but also the readability of the codebase. Developers are encouraged to infuse their code with:

- **Clarity in Names:** Variable and function names are not mere labels; they are beacons of understanding. Clear and descriptive nomenclature ensures that the codebase is an open book, inviting developers to explore its depths with confidence and ease.

- **Artistry in Comments:** In the tapestry of code, inline comments serve as annotations, unraveling the complexities. They elucidate intricate segments, offering insights into the developer's thought process. Each comment becomes a stepping stone for understanding, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Meticulous Documentation

In the Sage IDE universe, documentation is not just a manual; it is a chronicle of brilliance. The saga of development unfolds through meticulous documentation:

- **Inline Illumination:** For intricate code segments, inline comments are not just clarifications; they are illuminations. They transform complexity into comprehension, ensuring developers embark on a journey of understanding, guided by the developer's expertise.

- **Plugin Chronicles:** The plugin architecture is not a mystery; it is a narrative. Detailed documentation for plugin developers unveils the secrets, offering a roadmap into the architecture and usage guidelines. Developers become architects, empowered to craft plugins that resonate with Sage IDE's essence, shaping the future of software development.

### Robust Error Handling

In the labyrinth of software, errors are not roadblocks; they are stepping stones to improvement. Sage IDE navigates these challenges with finesse:

- **Dual Sentinels:** Errors are not just incidents; they are insights. Sage IDE distinguishes between Errors and FatalErrors. Errors serve as guides, illuminating the path to resolution,

 while FatalErrors stand as guardians, ensuring the integrity of the system. Each error becomes a catalyst for improvement, shaping the IDE's evolution.

- **Log of Wisdom:** Errors are not forgotten; they are immortalized. Every error and fatal error finds its sanctuary in "error.log," an archive of wisdom. This log, residing in the local directory, becomes the chronicle of Sage IDE's evolution, a testament to the relentless pursuit of excellence and continuous enhancement.

## Rigorous Testing

### Unit Tests

In the crucible of Sage IDE's development, tests are not just validations; they are affirmations of excellence. The unit tests are not mere rituals; they are expressions of confidence and quality assurance, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the IDE.
