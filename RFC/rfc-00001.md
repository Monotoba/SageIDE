# Sage IDE RFC 

## Summary
This RFC introduces the Sage IDE project. It outlines the projects goals and minimum specification.
Provide a concise summary of the RFC. What problem does it solve? What is the proposed solution? 

## Motivation
The Sage IDE concept arose from frustration with current AI coding tools. Their lack of interaction, and narrow focus. 
Even tools like ChatDev which claim to provide a development house all in one place, fall short as they limit development
iterations and rarely produce a complete working projects except for the simplest of projects. Sage IDE aims to combine
multiple AI agents and tools together with an IDE designed to include AI agents from the start! A fully integrated 
development experience with AI as a valuable partner, and not an afterthought.

Because this project is unique in its aim and offering, I am requesting comments from other developers. No matter your
level of experience. If you have suggestions please submit an RFC following the guidelines given in the RFC/RFC_PROCESS.md file.
